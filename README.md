This was my debugging assignment for Futureproofs Lap3 challenge.
The app is supposed to display sunrise & sunset times for major cities
such as London, New York etc
Technologies used are React, Redux & Jest to test

## Wins

- [x] All Navbar links work
- [x] Can now search sunrise/sunset times by capital city. Added preventDefault to onSubmit handler
## Challenges

- Tests are failing
- No data displayed by default yet. Supposed to fetch London

* cd to folder
* type `npm install` then `npm run dev`
* Open browser on localhost:8080
